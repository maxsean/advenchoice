          By fire the world was undone. From the heavens a dark and gray shroud engulfed the North.
          Perhaps you have seen it, what lies beyond the Ashen Veil. A murky, forgotten land where the cursed are coralled to mend their ailing souls.

          One day you will stand before the veil, without really knowing why, like a moth drawn to a flame. You will lose everything, your past, your future, your very light. None will have meaning, and you won't even care.

          Yet you would do anything to shed your curse. Then accept the fate of your ilk and face the trials that await you.
        </p>
