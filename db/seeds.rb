Something pushes Korsov forward, into a writhing mass of flesh and stone. His vision blurred, Korsov stumbles over debris and sways heavily into his surroundings. There is warmth, but it feels unnatural, almost malignant.")

e2 = Encounter.create(id: 2, chapter: "The Ashen Veil", body: "That song, it urges him to escape. Korsov, numb and irrational, deliberately thrashes at his prison. The masses of flesh and stone gradually give way, but Korsov was inpatient. Korsov reaches upward, a cool air embraces the tips of his fingers. He then senses an orange light emanating above. Transfixed by the glow, he leaps. His strength propels him skyward, a cold light rakes against his flesh. He lands hard into a derelict structure, a tower. It is then he feels a long chain tied to his waist. He severs it and hears it fall below.")

e3 = Encounter.create(id: 3, chapter: "The Ashen Veil", body: "For the first time in decades, Korsov inhales deeply, filling his lungs with an oddly cool dense air, and exhaling it sharply. It takes a minute for him to settle his breathing to a normal effortless rhythm. His senses gradually clear and he finds himself sitting by the shattered window of an office building, overlooking hundreds of thousands of gaunt, sickly creatures, all marching towards a thick gray dust storm in the distance. Above, high in the sky, an orange sphere meekly drops its light to the hallowed grounds below.
